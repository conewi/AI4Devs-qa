** Prompt 1 (Cursor claude 3.7 sonnet thinking) (Ask mode)
Context: seed.ts, position.spec.ts

In position.spec.js create a set of test with cypress to satisfy the following use cases:
- Using the page http://localhost:3000/positions/:id
1. Verify that the title of position is shown and has text.
2. Verify that columns are shown accordingly to each interview flow process.
3. Verify that candidate cards are shown in the correct column of each interview flow process.
4. This page use drag and drop to move candidate cards from one column to another one, validate that this drag and drop can be done.
5. Verify that candidate card can be dragged from one column and dropped to another column.
6. Verify that candidate interview step is updated accordingly when drag and drop is performed using the endpoint PUT /candidate/:id

Pre-conditions:
- Use seed data as an example of realistic data.
- Use seed data to know which positions and candidates are available for test accomplishment
- Ask me all that you need to create this end to end tests.
- Create a Readme_cypress.md file with the instructions to execute these tests.

Apply these changes to codebase, use @position.spec.js that is already being created.

** Prompt 2 Answer **
I've successfully applied the changes to the codebase:

# Created the Cypress test file at frontend/cypress/integration/position.spec.js with tests that:

- Verify the position title is displayed
- Check that interview columns are correctly shown
- Verify candidates appear in the right columns
- Test drag and drop functionality between columns
- Validate that the backend API is called correctly when candidates are moved

# Created a comprehensive Readme_cypress.md file with:

- Setup instructions
- Steps to run the tests
- Description of test scenarios
- Troubleshooting guidance

# Note: The linter warnings in the Cypress file are expected, as the 'cy' object is provided by Cypress at runtime and doesn't need to be imported. These warnings can be safely ignored as they won't affect the functionality of the tests.
